The NASA Prognostics Python Packages (ProgPy) are a set of open-sourced python packages supporting research and development of prognostics and health management tools. They implement architectures and common functionality of prognostics, supporting researchers and practitioners.

ProgPy consists of a set of packages, described below. See the documentation specific to each package for more information.  

* :ref:`prog_models<prog_models Guide>` : Tools for defining, building, using, and testing models for prognostics
* :ref:`prog_algs<prog_algs Guide>` : Tools for performing and benchmarking prognostics and state estimation
* :ref:`prog_server<prog_server Guide>` and :ref:`prog_client<prog_server Guide>` : A simplified implementation of a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for performing prognostics and associated client
