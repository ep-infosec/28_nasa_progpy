"""
This example performs a state estimation with uncertainty given a Prognostics Model for a system in which not all output values are measured. 
 
Method: An instance of the BatteryCircuit model in prog_models is created. We assume that we are only measuring one of the output values, and we define a subclass to remove the other output value.  
        Estimation of the current state is performed at various time steps, using the defined state_estimator.

Results: 
    i) Estimate of the current state given various times
    ii) Display of results, such as prior and posterior state estimate values and SOC
