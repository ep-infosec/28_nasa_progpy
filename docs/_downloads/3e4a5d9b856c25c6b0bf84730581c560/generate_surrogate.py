"""
Example of generating a Dynamic Mode Decomposition surrogate model from a battery model.

.. dropdown:: More details

    In this example, an instance of a battery model is created. The DMD DataModel is used to generate a surrogate of this battery model for specific loading schemes. This surrogate can be used in place of the original model, approximating it's behavior. Frequently, surrogate models run faster than the original, at the cost of some accuracy. The performance of the two models are then compared.
