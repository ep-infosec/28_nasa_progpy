        "\nExample further illustrating the concept of 'events' which generalizes EOL. \n\n'Events' is the term used to describe something to be predicted. \nGenerally in the PHM community these are referred to as End of Life (EOL). \nHowever, they can be much more.\n\nIn the prog_models package, events can be anything that needs to be predicted. \nEvents can represent End of Life (EOL), End of Mission (EOM), warning thresholds, or any Event of Interest (EOI). \n\nThis example demonstrates how events can be used in your applications. \n"
