"""
This example performs a state estimation and prediction with uncertainty given a Prognostics Model.
 
Method: An instance of the ThrownObject model in prog_models is created, and the prediction process is achieved in three steps:
    1) State estimation of the current state is performed using a chosen state_estimator, and samples are drawn from this estimate
    2) Prediction of future states (with uncertainty) and the times at which the event threshold will be reached
    3) Metrics tools are used to further investigate the results of prediction
Results: 
    i) Predicted future values (inputs, states, outputs, event_states) with uncertainty from prediction
    ii) Time event is predicted to occur (with uncertainty)
    iii) Various prediction metrics
    iv) Figures illustrating results
