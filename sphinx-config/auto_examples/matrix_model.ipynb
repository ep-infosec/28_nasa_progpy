        "\nThis example shows the use of the advanced feature - matrix models. Matrix models represent the state of the system using matricies instead of dictionaries. The provided model.StateContainer, InputContainer, and OutputContainer can be treated as dictionaries but use an underly matrix. This is important for some applications like surrogate and machine-learned models where the state is represented by a tensor, and operations by matrix operations. Simulation functions propogate the state using the matrix form, preventing the inefficiency of having to convert to and from dictionaries.\n\nIn this example, a model is designed to simulate a thrown object using matrix notation (instead of dictionary notation as in the standard model). The implementation of the model is comparable to a standard model, except that it uses the x.matrix, u.matrix, and z.matirx to compute matrix operations within each function.\n"
